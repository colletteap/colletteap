### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
âœ¨My name is Collette Lane and I am a student with Get Coding; I enrolled in 2023. I successfully completed my first project, Teacher Gratitude Planner, using HTML, CSS & Javascript.
This project allowed teachers to use a personalized calendar to keep track of special events and their to do list; focus on their personal growth through using a reflective journal and core values list; saved them time with a local storage substitute plan and gave them some resources during the tough times. If you would like to check it out, follow this link https://colletteap.github.io/gratitude-planner/. I am also working on a second project that helps job hunters track and celebrate their progress.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning next: React.js</br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy wood burning & engraving
