### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
âœ¨My name is Collette Lane and I am a student with Get Coding; I enrolled in 2023. I successfully completed my first project, Teacher Gratitude Planner, using HTML, CSS & Javascript.
This project allowed teachers to use a personalized calendar to keep track of special events and their to do list; focus on their personal growth through using a reflective journal and core values list; saved them time with a local storage substitute plan and gave them some resources during the tough times. If you would like to check it out, follow this link https://colletteap.github.io/gratitude-planner/. I am also working on a second project that is a booking site for a photography business.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning next: React.js</br>
âœ¨ I have over 110 instructional videos created on my YouTube channel teaching Microsoft applications - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWLX6J4_Ly1coIRbivJdtLA</br>
âœ¨ I have a Wix website created to help high school students find post-secondary programs, scholarships and resources in Newfoundland & Labrador - https://garlandcollette.wixsite.com/afterhighschool</br>
âœ¨ I have a self-published book on Amazon about early 1900's Labrador Fishing called *Salt of the Sea* - https://a.co/d/4hkweH2</br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy wood burning & engraving
